    <h1>Roasted Broccoli</h1>

    <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled! My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>

    <h2>Prepare the Broccoli</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut the florets from the stalk. </li>
        <li>Peel the stalk and cut into slices.</li>
        <li>Toss the florets and stem pieces with oil, then transfer to a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper and roast in the preheated oven.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Roast</h2>
    <p>In an oven preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, your broccoli should be perfectly roasted in about 20 minutes. Once it's tender and lightly browned, it's ready to eat!</p>
